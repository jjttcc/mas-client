# Format: "label_string<tab>setting"

# Does the month in a date specification start at zero rather than one -
# that is, does 0 indicate January and 11 indicate December?
# NOTE: This specification does not apply to the month settings specified
# in this file, which always start at 1; rather it specifies how the date
# settings are translated into the "HTTP GET" request for retrieving the
# specified range of data.  Note that the chart.yahoo.com site expects (as
# of Sep. 2002) months to start at zero and thus months_start_at_zero
# should be set to true if you are using yahoo's site.
# (Change "true" below to "false" or simply delete the "months_start_at_zero"
# specification below, since the default is false, to specify that months
# start at one.)
months_start_at_zero	true

# Specification for the start and end dates for the data to be retrieved
# "now" means, of course, the current date; if an actual date is used,
# it must be of the form: yyyymmdd.
eod_start_date	now - 4 years
eod_end_date	now

# The host component of the http URL used to retrieve market data
host	ichart.yahoo.com

# If a proxy needs to be used - for example, to get through a firewall -,
# the following two settings need to be uncommented and the correct values
# filled in for the proxy you are using.

output_field_separator	,

# The command to post-process the retrieved data, usually for the purpose of
# converting it into an expected format.  In this case, the specification
# is for a conversion component called "yahoo", which, as of July 2002, is
# the only internal conversion component available; more may be added later.
post_process_command	yahoo
#post_process_command	[none]

# The time at which to attempt to retrieve the latest end-of-day data from
# the http data-source site.  It should be in the user's local time.
# This needs to be set carefully: Too early and a lot of time will be wasted
# trying to retrieve data that doesn't exist yet; too late and your data
# will not be as up-to-date as it could be.  Format: hh:mm (24-hour clock)
eod_turnover_time	19:00

# These specifications prevent unecessary retrieval of data on a weekend
# if the current time is later than eod_turnover_time.  If data does need
# to be retrieved, remove or comment out the appropriate specification;
# for example, if a tradable is traded on Saturday and end-of-day data for
# it is available, comment out the "ignore_day_of_week	saturday"
# specification.
ignore_day_of_week	saturday
ignore_day_of_week	sunday
